# 2025 Gemini-Style UI/UX Overhaul

## Motivation

The previous chat interface, while functional, lacked the modern, clean look and intuitive layout of leading AI chat platforms like Google Gemini. The goal was to create a visually appealing, mobile-first, and highly usable interface that closely matches the Gemini experience.

## Major Changes

- **Pill-Shaped Message Input**: Redesigned the message input bar to be a pill-shaped container with SVG icons, add/attachment button, and microphone/send button, inspired by Gemini's UI.
- **Gemini-Style Sidebar**: Sidebar now features Google-style active chat highlighting, a cleaner layout, and provider/API key controls moved to the bottom for better accessibility.
- **Start Live Button Placement**: The Start Live button is now located in the input area, making it more discoverable and intuitive.
- **Custom CSS (No Bootstrap)**: Removed all Bootstrap dependencies. All styling is now handled with custom, mobile-first CSS for a clean, modern look and smooth animations.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The entire interface is now fully responsive, with touch-friendly controls, proper breakpoints, and optimized layouts for all device sizes.
- **Header and Controls**: Header is simplified, controls are centered, and vertical space is optimized for usability.
- **Icon-Based Live Controls**: Camera, microphone, and connect buttons now use Bootstrap Icons with accessible labels.
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Only the icon font is imported globally; no other Bootstrap CSS is used.
- **Connection Status Indicator**: Live mode displays connecting/connected/disconnected badges.
- **Touchable Voice Settings**: Voice selector opens on tap instead of hover for mobile support.
- **Compact Bottom Controls**: Reduced padding and icon sizes so text responses remain visible even on small screens.
